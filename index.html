        <h2>Kae Redesigns Pawnee's Website</h2>
          <p>I’m taking an online course (<a href="https://www.udemy.com/ux-web-design-master-course-strategy-design-development">UX
            and Web Design Master Course</a> by Joe Natoli on Udemy) to learn about the UX research and design process,
            and needed to pick something to work on. I’m a fan of the show Parks and Recreation, so I decided to make some
            updates to the faux government site for the fictional town of Pawnee, Indiana*. This site was made by NBC
            while the show was airing, and </p>

          <p>I’m treating this as a real situation, and since I wasn’t able to speak with actual users I referenced the
            show to determine what updates would be most effective.</p>

          <p>Currently I’m finishing the research for what needs to be updated and how that should happen, and starting
            on simple mockups in Photoshop. After that’s completed I’ll evaluate whether those mockups cover everything
            that they’re supposed to, and if so, I’ll start making more advanced wireframes in Sketch.</p>
